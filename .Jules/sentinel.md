## 2026-06-15 - [CRITICAL] Hardcoded Privy App Secret
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded Privy App Secret was found in `privy-client.js`. This secret was part of the `PRIVY_CONFIG` object and was exposed to the client-side, which is a major security risk.
**Learning:** Privy App Secrets are meant for server-side verification and should never be included in client-side code or repositories. The client-side SDK only requires the App ID.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for secrets and ensure they are only accessed in server-side environments. Regularly scan the codebase for hardcoded credentials. Added `.env.example` and untracked `.env` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

## 2026-06-16 - [HIGH] XSS Vulnerabilities in UI Rendering
**Vulnerability:** Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found in the application's UI. Dynamic data from user input (voice chat), AI responses, and external APIs (politician filings) were rendered using `innerHTML` without sanitization.
**Learning:** Even internal-facing dashboards or AI-driven chat interfaces are susceptible to XSS. Prompt injection can be used to trick an AI into generating malicious HTML/JS, which then executes in the user's browser if rendered unsafely.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize dynamic content before rendering. Use `textContent` or `document.createTextNode()` for simple text. For complex structures, implement a robust `escapeHTML` helper or use a library like DOMPurify. This project now utilizes a centralized `escapeHTML` pattern for dynamic template literals and safer DOM APIs for chat rendering.

## 2026-06-17 - [CRITICAL] Hardcoded Anthropic API Keys
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded Anthropic API key was found in multiple HTML files, including `index.html`, `index-new.html`, and redundant files in `kivy-app/`.
**Learning:** Redundant file structures and "demo" versions of the application can often harbor legacy hardcoded secrets that were removed from the main entry point but forgotten elsewhere.
**Prevention:** Use global grep scans for known secret patterns (like `sk-ant-`) across the entire repository regularly. Ensure that build artifacts or duplicated assets are either excluded from the repo or included in secret-scrubbing workflows.

## 2026-06-18 - [HIGH] XSS Vulnerability in Crucible Results Modal
**Vulnerability:** The `showCrucibleResults` function in `index.html` rendered the `results.mode` property directly into an `innerHTML` sink without sanitization.
**Learning:** Even metadata fields that are expected to be internal strings can be dangerous if there is any path for user-controlled data to reach them. Template literals in `innerHTML` are a common source of XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use the `escapeHTML` helper when rendering any string into an `innerHTML` template, or prefer safer alternatives like `textContent` for individual elements.
