## ✨ DELIVERED

### ✅ Ticker Now Tracks Each Trade
- **Live updates:** Shows actual trades instead of generic messages
- **Real-time info:** Token, method, price, time ago
- **Continuous:** Updates every 2-4 seconds with trade data
- **Visual:** Emoji indicators for each trade method
- **History:** Last 10 trades stored per bot

**Example Ticker Display:**
```
📈 ETH SPOT LONG @ $3,245.50 - 23s ago
📉 SOL SPOT SHORT @ $142.35 - 1m ago
🚀 BTC PERP LONG @ $45,230.25 - 45s ago
```

### ✅ Bot Personality Diversity System
- **5 unique personalities:** AGGRESSIVE, CONSERVATIVE, MOMENTUM, CONTRARIAN, BALANCED
- **Different token selection:** Each picks different coins based on style
- **Different methods:** AGGRESSIVE prefers leverage, CONSERVATIVE prefers stability
- **Different thresholds:** AGGRESSIVE trades more, CONSERVATIVE trades less
- **Visibly distinct:** Easy to see which bot is which by watching it trade

## 🎭 The 5 Personalities

### AGGRESSIVE 🔴 (Bot #1, #6, #11, ...)
- Picks **highest volatility** tokens (riskiest)
- Trades **most frequently** (threshold: 1/4 agents)
- Methods: **PERP LONG** (70%), SPOT LONG (30%)
- Result: Volatile altcoins with leverage

### CONSERVATIVE 🟢 (Bot #2, #7, #12, ...)
- Picks **lowest volatility** tokens (safest)
- Trades **least frequently** (threshold: 3/4 agents)
- Methods: **SPOT LONG** (50%), YIELD FARM (50%)
- Result: Stable large-cap coins, passive income

### MOMENTUM 🔴 (Bot #3, #8, #13, ...)
- Picks **strongest directional moves** (up or down)
- Trades **very frequently** (threshold: 1/4 agents)
- Methods: **PERP LONG** (65%), SPOT LONG (35%)
- Result: Trend-chasing, aggressive trend-following

### CONTRARIAN 🟡 (Bot #4, #9, #14, ...)
- Picks **worst performers** (betting against the crowd)
- Trades **medium** (threshold: 3/4 agents)
- Methods: **SPOT SHORT** (50%), SPOT LONG (50%)
- Result: Short-biased, contrarian bets

### BALANCED 🟡 (Bot #5, #10, #15, ...)
- Picks **top performers** (default strategy)
- Trades **medium** (threshold: 2/4 agents)
- Methods: **SPOT LONG** (33%), **PERP LONG** (33%), **YIELD FARM** (33%)
- Result: Diversified, mixed approach

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### Bot Creation (Personality Assignment)
```javascript
const personality = ['AGGRESSIVE', 'CONSERVATIVE', 'MOMENTUM', 'CONTRARIAN', 'BALANCED'][botCounter % 5];
```
Personalities cycle: Every 5th bot repeats the cycle

### Ticker Tracking (Real-Time)
```javascript
if(bot.lastTrade) {
  display = `${emoji} ${token} ${method} @ ${price} - ${timeAgo}`;
} else {
  display = genericScanningMessage();
}
```
Shows actual trades when available, generic messages while waiting

### Token Diversity (Personality-Specific Logic)
- **AGGRESSIVE:** `marketData.slice(0,10).reduce(maxByVolatility)`
- **CONSERVATIVE:** `marketData.filter(vol>100M).reduce(minByVolatility)`
- **MOMENTUM:** `marketData.reduce(maxByDirectionalMove)`
- **CONTRARIAN:** `marketData.reduce(minByPriceChange)`
- **BALANCED:** `marketData[0]` (default top)

### Threshold Adjustment (Risk Tolerance)
```javascript
let threshold = getLiveConsensus();  // Base: 2/4
if(personality === 'AGGRESSIVE') threshold -= 1;    // 1/4 - trade more
if(personality === 'CONSERVATIVE') threshold += 1;  // 3/4 - trade less
// ... similar for MOMENTUM, CONTRARIAN
```

### Method Selection (Style Preferences)
Each personality has different method probabilities:
- **AGGRESSIVE:** 70% PERP, 30% SPOT
- **CONSERVATIVE:** 50% SPOT, 50% YIELD
- **MOMENTUM:** 65% PERP, 35% SPOT
- **CONTRARIAN:** 50% SHORT, 50% LONG
- **BALANCED:** 33% each
