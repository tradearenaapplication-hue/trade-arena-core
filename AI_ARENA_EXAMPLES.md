  "token": "MATIC",
  "method": "SPOT SHORT",
  "edge_pct": 1.5,
  "confidence": 0.48,  // ← LOW! Trader doesn't like choppy markets
  "win_probability": 0.52,
  "reasoning": "Minor downtrend, but signals weak",
  "risk_level": "MEDIUM",
  "vote_score": 0.54  // Lower score due to low confidence
}

=== 🎯 STRATEGIST'S PROPOSAL ===
Market Assessment: Choppy with low volume - yield farm safer bet

Proposal:

Winner:     🔬 ANALYST (BTC ARBITRAGE)
Consensus:  0.68 (68% - Moderate agreement)

⚠️  Note: Consensus slightly lower because TRADER disagrees
     (But ANALYST/STRATEGIST align on conservative approach)
```

### Result

## Real Tournament #3: Extreme Volatility (Paused)

### Input: Extreme Volatility 📉
```
Market Snapshot:
- BTC: $39,500 (-8.2% 24h) ⚠️  EXTREME
- ETH: $2,100 (-7.9% 24h) ⚠️  EXTREME
- SOL: $82.00 (-14.1% 24h) ⚠️  EXTREME
- (others similar)

Average Volatility: 9.8% (EXTREME - > 8% threshold)
Market Condition: EXPLOSIVE_DOWN
```

### Arena Output

```javascript
🏟️ TOURNAMENT #3 - EXTREME VOLATILITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All 3 models propose trades:
  🔬 ANALYST: ARBITRAGE (high vol = high spreads)
  ⚡ TRADER:  PERP SHORT (ride the downtrend)
  🎯 STRATEGIST: ARBITRAGE (safest in extremes)

Vote Scores:
  🔬 ANALYST:    0.75
  🎯 STRATEGIST: 0.73
  ⚡ TRADER:     0.71

Winner: 🔬 ANALYST (ARBITRAGE)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ EXECUTION VALIDATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Check #1: Consensus ✅ 73%
Check #2: Confidence ✅ 75%
Check #3: Market Volatility
  Threshold:  ≤ 8.0%
  Actual:     9.8%
  Result:     ❌ FAIL (Too volatile!)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⏸️  DECISION: TRADE PAUSED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Reason: "Extreme volatility detected (9.8% > 8.0%)"

Explanation:
  Market is too chaotic. Even though models agreed,
  system protects us by pausing trades during extreme
  volatility to avoid whipsaws and liquidations.

Action:
  ✅ Models still analyzed
  ✅ Tournament still ran
  ⏹️  But trade blocked at validation gate
  ⏰ Wait for volatility to cool (< 8%)
```
