# AI STRATEGIES & MULTI-BOT SYSTEM

**Trade Arena v4 • Enhanced Auto-Trading with Intelligent Adaptations**

---

## ✨ NEW FEATURES

### 1. **More Bots Available**
- **Before**: 6 maximum bots
- **Now**: 12 maximum bots
- **Why**: Run more strategies simultaneously, diversify approaches

### 2. **AI Strategy Profiles**
Each bot automatically assigns a unique strategy profile that adapts in real-time:

| Profile | Style | Bet Size | Methods | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| **SCALPER** | Fast trades, tight spreads | 0.8x | Flash Loans, Arbitrage | High-frequency, low-risk |
| **TREND** | Follow momentum | 1.0x | Spot Long, Perps, Yield | Market uptrends |
| **AGGRESSIVE** | High risk/reward | 1.5x | Perp Long/Short | Volatile markets |
| **CONSERVATIVE** | Steady growth | 0.5x | Arbitrage, Yield Farm | Risk-averse, steady income |
| **BALANCED** | Mix everything | 1.0x | All methods (equal weight) | Diversified approach |
| **NICHE** | Alternative strategies | 1.2x | NFTs, Yield, Spot | Specialized markets |

### 3. **Dynamic Method Selection**
In **AUTO** mode, the system intelligently adjusts trading methods based on market conditions:

```
Market Condition    → Selected Method
─────────────────────────────────────
STABLE              → ARBITRAGE (tight spreads)
EXPLOSIVE_UP        → PERP LONG (ride the wave)
EXPLOSIVE_DOWN      → PERP SHORT or ARBITRAGE (safe)
VOLATILE            → FLASH LOAN (capitalize on spreads)
TRENDING_UP         → SPOT LONG (follow momentum)
TRENDING_DOWN       → ARBITRAGE (avoid downtrend)
LOW_LIQUIDITY       → ARBITRAGE (safest)
```

### 4. **Adaptive Edge Calculation**
Edge % adjusts automatically based on:

- **Win/Loss Streak**: Reduce after losses, increase after wins
- **Volatility**: Conservative profiles reduce edge in high volatility
- **Win Probability**: Higher probability = higher edge
- **Recent Win Rate**: Track last 20 trades, adapt accordingly

**Example**: Bot with 60% win rate in low-volatility market might get:
```
Base edge: 2.5%
After 2 wins: 2.5% × 1.15 = 2.88%
High volatility: 2.88% × 0.85 = 2.45% (reduced)
Final: 2.45% → 3.2% (probability adjustment)
```

### 5. **Intelligent Bet Sizing**
Bet amounts adjust based on:

- **Consecutive Losses**: Reduce to 30-50% of normal after losing streaks
- **Consecutive Wins**: Increase to 110% after winning streaks
- **Volatility**: Conservative profiles bet 60% less in volatile conditions
- **Liquidity**: Bet 50% less in low-liquidity environments
- **Account Risk**: Never bet > 10% of balance

**Example**: $10 bet adjustments:
```
Normal: $10
After 2 losses: $10 × 0.7 = $7
In high volatility: $7 × 0.85 = $5.95
In low liquidity: $5.95 × 0.5 = $3 (final)
```

### 6. **Real-Time Risk Management**
Each bot monitors and adjusts for:

- **Max Drawdown**: Stop trading if session loss exceeds limit
- **Consecutive Losses**: Pause after 5+ consecutive losses
- **Market Crashes**: Conservative mode pauses in explosive downtrends
- **Method Performance**: Track which methods work best for each bot

## 🎯 HOW AUTO MODE WORKS NOW

### Step 1: Market Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze market conditions
volatility = average of top 8 coins 24h change
volume = average daily volume
condition = STABLE, EXPLOSIVE_UP, VOLATILE, etc.
```

### Step 2: Strategy Selection
```javascript
// Choose best method for this market condition
method = selectAdaptiveMethod(strategy, marketConditions)
// e.g., VOLATILE market → FLASH LOAN
```

### Step 3: Edge Calculation
```javascript
// Calculate optimal edge percentage
edge = calculateAdaptiveEdge(
  strategy,
  marketConditions,
  botState,
  baseEdge,
  winProbability
)
// Adjusts based on wins/losses/volatility
```

### Step 4: Bet Sizing
```javascript
// Calculate safe bet amount
bet = calculateAdaptiveBetSize(
  strategy,
  marketConditions,
  botState,
  baseBet,
  availableBalance
)
// Reduces after losses, increases after wins
```

### Step 5: Execute Trade
```javascript
// Use adaptive values
actualBet = decision.adaptiveBet    // Intelligent sizing
actualEdge = decision.adaptiveEdge  // Adjusted edge
method = decision.adaptiveMethod    // Market-aware method
```

### Step 6: Update State
```javascript
// Track performance for next trade
updateBotStateAfterTrade(strategy, decision, pnl, bet)
// Updates: consecutiveWins/Losses, recent P&L, method bias
```

---

## 📊 STRATEGY STATE TRACKING

Each bot tracks:

```javascript
{
  botId: 1,
  profile: "SCALPER",
  tradesCount: 42,
  consecutiveWins: 2,
  consecutiveLosses: 0,
  recentPnL: [+10, -5, +8, ...],  // Last 20 trades
  sessionPnL: +125.50,
  riskMultiplier: 1.08,
  adaptiveEdgeAdjustment: 1.12,
  adaptiveBetAdjustment: 0.95,
  methodBias: {
    "ARBITRAGE": { wins: 25, losses: 10, avgPnL: 8.5 },
    "FLASH LOAN": { wins: 5, losses: 2, avgPnL: 12.1 }
  }
}
```

---

## 🤖 EXAMPLE: SCALPER BOT IN ACTION

**Scenario**: Market going volatile, Bitcoin up 3%, Ethereum up 2%

### Step 1: Market Analysis
```
Volatility: 2.8% (MEDIUM)
Volume: 800M (HIGH)
Direction: BULLISH
Condition: TRENDING_UP
```

### Step 2: Profile-Based Selection
```
SCALPER Profile methods: ARBITRAGE, FLASH LOAN
Optimal for TRENDING_UP: ARBITRAGE preferred
Selected: ARBITRAGE ✓
```

### Step 3: Edge Calculation
```
Base edge from Claude AI: 2.0%
Recent win rate (last 20): 58%
Volatility adjustment: ×1.0 (medium volatility, neutral)
Consecutive wins: 0 (no adjustment)
Final edge: 2.0% × (1 + (0.58-0.5)×0.5) = 2.08% ✓
```

### Step 4: Bet Sizing
```
Base bet: $10
SCALPER multiplier: 0.8 (conservative)
Base: $10 × 0.8 = $8
Recent win rate: 58% (no adjustment)
Volatility adjustment: ×1.0 (medium, no change)
Final bet: $8 ✓
```

### Step 5: Spin
```
Claude suggests: PEPE spot long, 1.7x multiplier
AI Strategy adjusts to: ARBITRAGE (market-aware)
Edge shown: 2.08%
Bet shown: $8
Win probability: 57%
```

### Step 6: Result (Win!)
```
Gross P&L: $8 × 1.7x = +$13.60
Gas + Slippage: -$0.15
Net P&L: +$13.45

Update bot state:
✓ consecutiveWins = 1
✓ recentPnL = [..., +13.45]
✓ riskMultiplier = 1.08 (slight increase)
✓ ARBITRAGE win counted
```

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### 1. **Diversify Profiles**
```
DON'T: Create 6 SCALPER bots
DO:    Mix SCALPER, CONSERVATIVE, TREND, AGGRESSIVE
```

### 2. **Start Small in Auto**
```
First bot: $1 bet in AUTO
Second/third: $5-10 bets
Monitor results
Then scale up
```

### 3. **Monitor Strategy Adaptation**
```
In AUTO mode, watch:
• Pills changing method (market adaptation)
• Auto Edge % moving (volatility adjustment)
• Consecutive wins/losses (sizing changes)
• Recent win rate % (strategy effectiveness)
```

### 4. **Let Bots Run Independently**
```
Each bot manages own:
✓ Strategy selection
✓ Edge calculation
✓ Bet sizing
✓ Risk management
✓ Method performance tracking

You just:
• Set initial bet size
• Click AUTO
• Monitor overall portfolio
```

### 5. **Review Performance**
```
Check in browser console:
getBotStrategyInsights(botStrategies[1])

Look for:
• Consistent win rate > 50%
• Best performing methods
• Efficient risk management
• Reasonable edge adjustments
```

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Market Analysis Algorithm
```javascript
// Fetch top 8 coins, analyze:
volatility = avg(absolute(24h_change))
volume = avg(daily_volume)
momentum = avg(24h_change)

// Classify market
if (volatility < 2% && volume > 500M) → STABLE
if (volatility > 5% && change > 0) → EXPLOSIVE_UP
if (volatility > 5% && change < 0) → EXPLOSIVE_DOWN
... etc
```

### Edge Adjustment Formula
```javascript
edge = baseEdge
edge *= (1 + (winProbability - 0.5) * 0.5)
edge *= volatilityMultiplier (0.6-1.2 based on profile)
edge *= consecutiveWinMultiplier (0.8-1.15)
edge = clamp(minEdge, maxEdge)
```

### Bet Sizing Formula
```javascript
bet = baseBet
bet *= profileMultiplier (0.5-1.5)
bet *= volatilityMultiplier (0.5-1.3)
bet *= consecutiveLossMultiplier (0.7-0.5)
bet *= consecutiveWinMultiplier (1.0-1.1)
bet = max(1, min(bet, maxBet))
```
