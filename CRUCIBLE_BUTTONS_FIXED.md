# 🐛 Crucible Buttons - Fixed

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Naming Conflict**
- The dropdown selector had `id="crucibleMode"`
- But there was already a boolean variable `crucibleMode = false` (line 898)
- This created a naming conflict where the DOM element and JavaScript variable were in conflict
- The `runCrucibleBatch()` function tried to access `document.getElementById('crucibleMode')` which was ambiguous

### 2. **No Button State Management**
- The RUN BATCH button had no disabled state during execution
- Users could click multiple times and queue up multiple batch runs simultaneously
- This would cause unexpected behavior with overlapping trades

### 3. **No Error Handling**
- If the batch run failed, the button would remain disabled or in an inconsistent state
- The function needed try/finally to ensure button state is restored

## Solutions Applied

### ✅ Fix #1: Rename DOM Element
```javascript
// OLD:
<select id="crucibleMode" ...>

// NEW:
<select id="crucibleModeSelect" ...>
```
- Changed dropdown ID from `crucibleMode` to `crucibleModeSelect`
- Eliminates naming conflict with the boolean variable
- Makes code intent clearer (suffix "Select" indicates it's a form control)

### ✅ Fix #2: Add Button Class & Updated Handler
```javascript
// OLD:
<button onclick="runCrucibleBatch()">▶ RUN BATCH</button>

// NEW:
<button class="crucible-run-btn" onclick="runCrucibleBatch()"
  style="...transition:all 0.2s">▶ RUN BATCH</button>
```
- Added CSS class `crucible-run-btn` for easy selection
- Added transition CSS for smooth disabled state
- Allows button to be disabled during batch execution

### ✅ Fix #3: Update Function Reference
```javascript
// OLD:
const mode = document.getElementById('crucibleMode')?.value || 'TEST';

// NEW:
const mode = document.getElementById('crucibleModeSelect')?.value || 'TEST';
```
- Updated function to use new element ID

### ✅ Fix #4: Add Button State Management
```javascript
async function runCrucibleBatch() {
  const runBtn = document.querySelector('.crucible-run-btn');
  if(runBtn) runBtn.disabled = true;  // 🔴 DISABLE during run

  try {
    // ... batch execution logic ...
  } finally {
    if(runBtn) runBtn.disabled = false;  // 🟢 RE-ENABLE when done
  }
}
```
- Button is disabled when batch starts
- Button is re-enabled when batch completes (even if errors occur)
- Uses try/finally to guarantee button state restoration

## Testing

The fixes ensure:
- ✅ No more naming conflicts
- ✅ Single batch run at a time (button disabled prevents stacking)
- ✅ Robust error handling (finally block restores button)
- ✅ Better UX (visual feedback via disabled state)
