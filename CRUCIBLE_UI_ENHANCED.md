# ✨ CRUCIBLE MODE UI - ENHANCED

## What Was Added

Your Crucible mode now has a **complete control panel** for batch trading:

---

## 🎛️ New Crucible Controls

### 1. **Mode Selector**
```
Mode: [TEST ▼]
     - TEST (no API, simulated)
     - REAL (live prices)
     - ENTERTAINMENT (just for fun)
```
✅ Lets you choose which mode to run

### 2. **Trade Count Input**
```
Trades: [50]  (1-1000)
```
✅ Set how many trades to run in batch

### 3. **Run Batch Button**
```
▶ RUN BATCH
```
✅ Executes all trades in sequence automatically

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Configure
1. Scroll to **"🔬 CRUCIBLE"** section (near bottom)
2. Select **Mode**: TEST (safest for first run)
3. Enter **Trades**: 50 (good starting point)

### Step 2: Execute
1. Click **"▶ RUN BATCH"** button
2. Watch progress bar fill (0% → 100%)
3. Trades execute automatically

### Step 3: Results
```
Crucible Batch Complete!

Mode: TEST
Trades: 50
Start: $50.00
End: $52.30
P&L: +$2.30 (4.60%)
```

---

## What It Does

The **RUN BATCH** function:

✅ **Auto-selects bots** - picks available bots randomly
✅ **Runs trades sequentially** - one after another
✅ **Stops on broke** - halts if balance < $0.10
✅ **Updates progress** - shows status while running
✅ **Reports results** - final P&L summary
