# 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: 3 NEW FEATURES

## Feature 1: Google Login ✅
- **Status:** Already have Google script in head (`<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async></script>`)
- **Needs:** Google OAuth2 setup + login handler + account creation

## Feature 2: Create Own Wallet 🔐
- **Status:** Generate new wallet in app
- **Uses:** Ethers.js Wallet (already included)
- **Needs:** Wallet generation, local storage, key management UI

## Feature 3: Master STOP/PLAY Buttons ⏸️
- **Status:** Individual bots have AUTO button, need global control
- **Needs:** Two new buttons, global state, update all bots simultaneously

## Let's Build These Features

### FEATURE 1: Google Login Implementation

I'll add:
1. Google OAuth2 button styling (already have HTML)
2. `loginGoogle()` function
3. Account creation on first login
4. Auto-wallet generation for Google users

### FEATURE 2: App-Generated Wallet

I'll add:
1. "Create Wallet" option on login screen
2. Wallet generation using ethers.js
3. Private key storage (encrypted option)
4. Wallet display in app (address, balance)

### FEATURE 3: Master Stop/Play Controls

I'll add:
1. Global control buttons in header
2. `stopAllBots()` function
3. `playAllBots()` function
4. Visual indicator showing global state

## Ready to Implement?

Before I code these, confirm:

### Question 1: Google Login Details
- Should we store user data (email, name) in browser storage?
- Should we create auto-wallet for Google users?
- Should we allow connecting existing MetaMask after Google login?

**My Recommendation:** Yes to all three - gives users flexibility

### Question 2: App Wallet - Storage
- Store private key in browser localStorage (simple, fast)?
- Or require password each time (more secure)?
- Or use browser Wallet API (secure, but limited browser support)?

**My Recommendation:** Password-optional encrypted storage (balance of security & UX)

### Question 3: Master Stop/Play Behavior
- Should STOP pause bots or stop them completely?
- Should PLAY resume from where they stopped or restart them?
- What happens to auto-spins in progress?

**My Recommendation:** STOP = pause auto-spins (keep funds), PLAY = resume auto-spins

---

## Implementation Order

I propose:
1. **First:** Master Stop/Play (easiest, 5 min)
2. **Second:** App-Generated Wallet (medium, 15 min)
3. **Third:** Google Login (hardest, needs OAuth setup, 20 min)

**Total time:** ~40 minutes

## Answer These Questions:

1. **For Google Login:**
   - [ ] Store user profile data (email/name)?
   - [ ] Auto-create wallet for Google users?
   - [ ] Allow MetaMask connection after Google login?

2. **For App Wallet:**
   - [ ] Simple storage (fast, less secure)?
   - [ ] Password-protected storage (more secure)?
   - [ ] What initial balance to show?

3. **For Master Controls:**
   - [ ] STOP = pause spins temporarily?
   - [ ] PLAY = resume paused spins?
   - [ ] Show global status?

Or just say **"Build all three with your recommended approach!"** and I'll implement them now 🚀
