## 🎮 HOW IT WORKS (Step-by-Step)

```
1. USER CLICKS ▶️ AUTO
        ↓
2. FETCH MARKET DATA
   (8 top coins, volatility, volumes)
        ↓
3. RUN TOURNAMENT
   🔬 ANALYST analyzes    ⚡ TRADER analyzes    🎯 STRATEGIST analyzes
   (in parallel - fast)
        ↓
4. VOTE ON PROPOSALS
   Calculate vote scores for each proposal
   Vote Score = (40% × Confidence) +
                (30% × Edge) +
                (20% × Win Prob) +
                (10% × Risk)
        ↓
5. DETERMINE WINNER
   Highest vote score wins
   Calculate consensus strength
        ↓
6. VALIDATE EXECUTION
   ✅ Consensus ≥ 65%
   ✅ Confidence ≥ 60%
   ✅ Volatility ≤ 8%
   ✅ All data valid

   If any FAIL → TRADE PAUSED
   If all PASS → CONTINUE
        ↓
7. EXECUTE TRADE
   Execute winning proposal
        ↓
8. SPIN ANIMATION
   (3-5 seconds)
        ↓
9. DETERMINE RESULT
   WIN or LOSS
        ↓
10. UPDATE SYSTEM
    Record model win/loss
    Update leaderboard
    Display results with Arena info
        ↓
11. REPEAT
    Schedule next auto-spin
```

Week 2: Choppy Market
→ ANALYST wins 75% of tournaments
→ System learns: ANALYST excels in sideways

Week 3: Mixed Conditions
→ STRATEGIST wins 70% of tournaments
→ System learns: STRATEGIST is balanced winner

Result:
Leaderboard shows which model is best for current conditions
System can weight future decisions based on performance
```

## 🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES

### Validation Gates:
```
Consensus Check:      Need 65%+ agreement
Confidence Check:     Need 60%+ avg confidence
Market Check:         Volatility ≤ 8%
Sanity Check:         Valid token/method/edge

If ANY check fails → TRADE PAUSED (logged)
```

### Error Handling:
```
If API fails:         Use fallback (safe arbitrage)
If 1 model fails:     Others continue
If all fail:          Fallback executes
If validation fails:  Trade paused (safe)
```
