## 🎮 First Session Walkthrough

### Setup (1 minute)
```
1. Open index.html
2. Click "DEMO" for test balance ($10,000)
3. Add 3 bots: Click "+ ADD BOT" 3 times
```

### Configure (1 minute)
```
1. Bot 1: Set $1 bet, click AUTO
2. Bot 2: Set $2 bet, click AUTO
3. Bot 3: Set $3 bet, click AUTO
```

### Watch & Learn (5 minutes)
```
Observe:
✓ Pills changing (Token, Method, Edge, Auto Edge)
✓ Each bot spins every 3-8 seconds (auto mode)
✓ Ticker shows results with market condition
✓ Win rates showing (e.g., "58% WR")
✓ P&L updating on each bot
✓ Global balance updating

After 15-20 spins per bot, check:
console.log(botStrategies)
Or: getBotStrategyInsights(botStrategies[1])
```

### Scale Up (if positive)
```
If session P&L is positive:
1. Keep bots running
2. Let them go for 100+ trades each
3. Monitor portfolio P&L
4. Gradually increase bet sizes
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Choosing Strategy Profiles

Each bot gets random profile. To influence, you can:

```
Create multiple bots and note their profiles:
  Bot #1: SCALPER (fast trades)
  Bot #2: CONSERVATIVE (steady)
  Bot #3: TREND (momentum)
  etc.

Then decide to focus on specific profiles:
  Add more SCALPER-like bots for stable markets
  Add CONSERVATIVE bots for steady income
  Add AGGRESSIVE bots for volatile markets
```

### Setting Bet Amounts

```
Conservative approach:
  First 3 bots: $1 each
  Next 3 bots: $2 each
  Run 20-30 trades to verify

Moderate approach:
  First 3 bots: $5 each
  Next 3 bots: $10 each
  Run 50+ trades to optimize

Aggressive approach:
  Mix of $10-$50 bets
  Only if confident in system
  Monitor closely
```

### Monitoring Best Practices

```
Every 20-30 trades:
✓ Check win rate (target >53%)
✓ Check best method (which works best?)
✓ Check if drawdown acceptable
✓ Decide: increase bets or adjust profiles

Every 100+ trades:
✓ Calculate ROI (P&L / initial balance)
✓ Compare profiles (which performing best?)
✓ Decide: scale up or adjust strategy
```

## 🎯 Daily Operations

### Before Session
```
1. Open index.html
2. Connect wallet or use DEMO
3. Check market conditions:
   - If stable: SCALPER bots work better
   - If trending: TREND bots work better
   - If volatile: AGGRESSIVE bots work better
```

### During Session
```
1. Add bots or use existing ones
2. Set bet amounts
3. Click AUTO on all
4. Minimize/focus on other tasks
5. Check back every 30-60 minutes
```

### Monitoring
```
Every 30 minutes:
✓ Check global P&L
✓ Note any bots paused (if > 5 losses)
✓ Verify no critical issues

Every 2-4 hours:
✓ Review win rates per bot
✓ Check best performing method
✓ Consider adjusting bet sizes
✓ Decide to continue or pause
```

### After Session
```
1. Review final session results
2. Calculate: Total P&L / Trades / Avg P&L per trade
3. Note: Which profiles worked best
4. Log: How many trades, win rate, best methods
5. Plan: Adjustments for next session
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Dashboard (Console)

### Quick Status Check
```javascript
// Type in browser console (F12):

// See all bot states
console.log(botStrategies)

// Get summary for each bot
Object.values(botStrategies).forEach(b => {
  const wr = (b.recentPnL.filter(p => p > 0).length /
              Math.max(1, b.recentPnL.length) * 100).toFixed(0);
  console.log(`Bot ${b.botId} (${b.profile}): ${b.tradesCount} trades, $${b.sessionPnL.toFixed(2)} P&L, ${wr}% WR`);
});

// See market analysis
analyzeMarketConditions(marketCache)

// Get detailed insights for bot 1
getBotStrategyInsights(botStrategies[1])
```

### Deep Dive Analysis
```javascript
// Method performance for bot 1
console.table(botStrategies[1].methodBias)

// Recent P&L history
console.log(botStrategies[1].recentPnL)

// Risk multiplier (how confident system is)
console.log(botStrategies[1].riskMultiplier)

// Total portfolio P&L
const totalPL = Object.values(botStrategies)
  .reduce((sum, b) => sum + b.sessionPnL, 0);
console.log('Total Portfolio P&L: $' + totalPL.toFixed(2))
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Bot keeps pausing (hitting max losses)
```
Cause: Strategy profile too aggressive for current market
Solution:
  1. Check market with analyzeMarketConditions()
  2. If VOLATILE, use CONSERVATIVE profile bots
  3. Reduce bet size
  4. Remove and re-add bot with conservative bet
```

### Issue: Method not changing
```
Cause: Market condition is stable (correct behavior!)
Solution:
  1. This is normal in stable markets
  2. System will adapt when market changes
  3. Watch for volatility spike, then method will change
  4. Or manually close bot if want different method
```

### Issue: Win rate too low
```
Cause: AI not accurate for current market OR strategy mismatch
Solution:
  1. Check if profile matches market (TREND bot in downtrend = bad)
  2. Reduce bet size to protect capital
  3. Run more trades (>50) to get accurate sample
  4. If still <50% after 100+ trades, reduce system reliance
```

### Issue: Bets getting smaller every trade
```
Cause: Losing streak (correct behavior!)
Solution:
  1. This is risk management working
  2. System protecting capital
  3. Let it continue or manually stop with STOP button
  4. After recovering wins, bets will increase again
```

### Issue: "Insufficient balance" error
```
Cause: Wallet doesn't have enough funds
Solution:
  1. Check balance in header
  2. Fund wallet with more ETH (if using real)
  3. Or click DEMO for $10k test balance
  4. Bet sizes will auto-reduce if balance too low
```

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Metrics to Monitor

```
Per Bot:
  ✓ Trade count (should increase steadily)
  ✓ Win rate (target >53%)
  ✓ Session P&L (should increase with wins)
  ✓ Best method (which works best for this bot?)
  ✓ Drawdown (how much did it lose in worst streak?)

Portfolio:
  ✓ Total trades (all bots combined)
  ✓ Overall win rate (target >53%)
  ✓ Total P&L
  ✓ ROI (P&L / starting balance)
  ✓ Daily P&L trend
```

### Benchmarks

```
Good performance:
  ✓ Win rate 53-60%
  ✓ P&L positive after 50+ trades
  ✓ Most profiles profitable
  ✓ Adaptive edge < 3% variance from base

Needs adjustment:
  ✓ Win rate < 50% after 100 trades
  ✓ Negative P&L sustained
  ✓ One profile losing consistently
  ✓ Bots pausing frequently

Excellent performance:
  ✓ Win rate > 58%
  ✓ Consistent daily gains
  ✓ Multiple profitable profiles
  ✓ Minimal pausing
```

## 🚀 Optimization Tips

### Tip 1: Diversify Profiles
```
DON'T: Run 6 SCALPER bots (if one profile fails, all fail)
DO: Mix SCALPER, CONSERVATIVE, TREND, BALANCED
Result: Some bots profit, some break even, portfolio stays positive
```

### Tip 2: Start Small, Scale Gradually
```
Trade 1-10: $1 bets (verify system works)
Trade 11-50: $2-5 bets (test strategy consistency)
Trade 51-100: $5-10 bets (scale if profitable)
Trade 100+: Scale based on results
```

### Tip 3: Let Bots Run Independently
```
DO: Create 6 bots with different profiles
DO: Set AUTO on each
DO: Minimize and check every hour
DON'T: Constantly adjust bets
DON'T: Stop/start constantly
Result: System finds optimal equilibrium
```

### Tip 4: Review Market Conditions
```
Before starting session:
  1. Check analyzeMarketConditions(marketCache)
  2. Note if STABLE, VOLATILE, TRENDING, etc.
  3. Adjust bot selection based on condition
  4. STABLE? Use SCALPER bots
  5. VOLATILE? Use AGGRESSIVE bots
  6. TRENDING? Use TREND bots
```

### Tip 5: Monitor Method Performance
```
Track which methods work best per bot:
  console.log(botStrategies[1].methodBias)

If ARBITRAGE has 70% win rate:
  Create more SCALPER bots (prefer ARBITRAGE)
If PERP LONG has 40% win rate:
  Avoid TREND profile in bear markets
```
