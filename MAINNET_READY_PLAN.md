# 🛡️ Trade Arena — Mainnet Readiness & Live Operations Project Plan

This document serves as the authoritative, phased project plan and technical architecture blueprint required to transition **Trade Arena** from staging/simulation to a highly secure, audited, and resilient live on-chain trading platform on **Base Mainnet**.

### 🔗 Context, Branches, & Live Deployments
- **Repository & Branch:** `danhale93/Trade-Arena` (Branch: `chore/add-render-link`)
- **Ready Pull Request Link:** [GitHub Compare / Pull Request](https://github.com/danhale93/Trade-Arena/compare/main...chore/add-render-link?expand=1)
- **Live Staging/Prod App URL:** [Staging/Production Instance on Render](https://trade-arena-app.onrender.com)
- **Key Current Additions:** `README`, `.env.example`, `scripts/rpc-check.js`, `scripts/fork-test.js`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## 📌 Executive Summary
*   **Target Network:** Base Mainnet (Chain ID: `8453`)
*   **Staging Environment:** `trade-arena-staging.onrender.com` (Mapped to staging `RENDER_SERVICE_ID_STAGING`)
*   **Production Environment:** `trade-arena-app.onrender.com` (Mapped to production `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`)
*   **Security Principle:** **Safety-First / Zero-Trust Automation**. No live-money automated trade execution will be enabled until multi-signature controls, transaction simulations, rigorous smart contract/infrastructure audits, and dynamic circuit breakers are fully implemented, verified, and signed off.
*   **Key Paradigm Shift:** Moving away from hot-wallet automated keys to a **hybrid relayer + secure vault/multisig paradigm**, protecting critical user and protocol assets from compromise.

## 1. Phased Project Plan & Milestones

The project is structured into four distinct, logical phases designed to de-risk the deployment progressively.

```
┌────────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────────┐
│        PHASE 0         │     │        PHASE 1         │     │        PHASE 2         │     │        PHASE 3         │
│    Immediate Safety    │ ──> │ Staging, Fork Testing  │ ──> │   Secure Signing &     │ ──> │   Production Rollout   │
│       & Controls       │     │     & Paper Trading    │     │    External Audits     │     │      & Go-Live         │
└────────────────────────┘     └────────────────────────┘     └────────────────────────┘     └────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 0: Immediate Safety, Pre-Execution Guardrails, & Risk Controls
*   **Focus:** Harden the existing Node.js/Express backend (`server.js`) and trading engine bundle (`public/trading-bundle.js`) with deterministic execution limits, simulation steps, automated spend limit controls, and local validation.
*   **Milestone:** All bots running locally or in dev modes are governed by hard limits and automated spend limit controls. Pre-execution checks prevent garbage transactions from being signed.
*   **Target Date:** Week 1 (Target: March 30, 2026)

### Phase 1: Staging Environment, Mainnet-Fork Testing, & Paper-Trading
*   **Focus:** Establish an isolated staging environment (`trade-arena-staging.onrender.com`), configure continuous integration pipelines, and initiate a continuous dry-run period.
*   **Milestone:** CI/CD automatically runs unit and mainnet-fork simulation tests on every Pull Request. Staging environment initiates a 14-day continuous paper-trading campaign with zero unhandled exceptions.
*   **Target Date:** Weeks 2-3 (Target: April 13, 2026)

### Phase 2: Production-Grade Signing, Relayer Infrastructure, & Audits
*   **Focus:** Decouple transaction signing from the application server. Setup Gnosis Safe multisig custody combined with a secure automated relayer (e.g., Gelato, OpenZeppelin Defender, or Biconomy) and initiate external reviews.
*   **Milestone:** Secure signing architecture deployed to staging. Core smart contracts (e.g., payout contracts, flash loan execution contracts) submitted to third-party auditors.
*   **Target Date:** Weeks 4-6 (Target: May 4, 2026)

### Phase 3: Production Rollout, Incident Response Dry-Runs, & Go-Live
*   **Focus:** Launch the production application (`trade-arena-app.onrender.com`), execute live-money dry runs with tiny capital caps, perform "game day" disaster simulations (e.g., global kill-switch triggers), and finalize cutover.
*   **Milestone:** Stable, live mainnet trading active under a strict 0.1 ETH global loss ceiling. Automated monitoring dashboards fully integrated with on-call alerting.
*   **Target Date:** Week 7 (Target: May 11, 2026)

## 4. Security & Signing Design

Storing private keys on a cloud application server (like Render) is a major attack vector. Compromise of the server would mean a total drain of all capital.

### Recommended Architecture: Non-Custodial Multisig + Relayer + HSM / Vault
Instead of keeping a raw private key on Render, we use a decentralized transaction execution model or a secure signing HSM/Vault API:

#### 1. Hardware Security Module (HSM) & Secure Key Vault Integration
To secure automated transactions, we recommend utilizing an enterprise-grade HSM or Vault (such as **AWS CloudHSM**, **Google Cloud KMS**, or **HashiCorp Vault** with transit secrets engine) for programmatic automated signatures:
*   **Decoupled Signing Key:** The server on Render never handles the plaintext private key. It holds secure IAM/API credentials to access the Vault's transit signing API.
*   **On-Demand Signature requests:** The application server calls the Vault/HSM API `sign()` operation with the pre-formatted transaction payload.
*   **Policy Enforcements:** Strict policies are applied inside the Vault configuration to only allow signatures matching specific allowed contract targets and maximum daily volumes.

#### 2. Hybrid Safe + Relayer Paradigm
Alternatively, we utilize the Multisig Gnosis Safe with a Gas Relayer approach to preserve decentralized execution boundaries:

```
┌─────────────────┐               ┌─────────────────┐               ┌──────────────────┐
│   Trade Arena   │  (Simulates)  │ OpenZeppelin /  │ (Dispatches)  │   Gnosis Safe    │
│ Backend Server  │ ------------> │ Gelato Relayer  │ ------------> │ 2-of-3 Multisig  │
│    (Render)     │               │  (Gas Sponsor)  │               │ (Execution Owner)│
└─────────────────┘               └─────────────────┘               └──────────────────┘
```

1.  **Gnosis Safe (Safe Contract):** Holds the principal trading capital. Authorized owners are separate offline keys (e.g., Ledger/Trezor devices held by the team).
2.  **Relayer Service:** We register a relayer (such as Gelato or OpenZeppelin Defender). The relayer has permission to call a specialized execution function on our smart contracts, *but only under strict conditions* (e.g., checked inside our smart contracts: verified target DEX, authorized assets, limited volume).
3.  **No Server Keys:** The Render server does not hold the master safe private key. If the server is hacked, the attacker cannot withdraw funds directly because the safe contracts only accept transactions that satisfy strict on-chain validation limits.

### Alternatives Considered

*   **Standalone Cloud HSM / HashiCorp Vault:** Keep keys inside a cloud HSM (AWS CloudHSM or Google KMS) and allow the backend to sign transactions programmatically via IAM.
    *   *Pros:* Complete automation support.
    *   *Cons:* Server compromise can still request unlimited signatures unless strict rate-limiting rules are configured inside the Vault policy.
*   **Gnosis Safe + Relayer (Recommended):** Use a multi-signature safe as the capital treasury, and authorize a dedicated Smart Contract Executor via a Relayer.
    *   *Pros:* Capital is kept completely safe inside a multi-signature wallet. Automated execution is restricted to a custom router contract containing strict safety rules.

---

### Nonce Management & Retry Backoff Strategy

To prevent transaction failures due to underpriced gas or out-of-order nonces, the backend uses a robust queue system:
1. **FIFO Queue:** All transactions are routed through an in-memory queue per hot/relayer account to maintain transaction order.
2. **Dynamic Gas Escalation:** If a transaction remains unconfirmed for more than 3 blocks, a replacement transaction is dispatched with the same nonce and a 20% increase in `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`.
3. **Exponential Backoff:** If the RPC fails with a 429 (rate-limit) or 503 (server error), the backend retries with an exponential backoff formula: $t_{wait} = 2^{attempt} \times 500 \text{ ms} + \text{jitter}$.

---

### Proof-of-Concept Integration Code (Ethers.js + Safe Protocol)

Below is the design pattern for queuing and submitting transactions to the Relayer rather than signing locally:

```javascript
// services/payouts/secureSigner.js
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const axios = require('axios');

async function executeSecureTransaction(targetContractAddress, encodedData, estimatedGasLimit) {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);

  // 1. Pre-execution Simulation via Tenderly/Alchemy
  const isSimulationOk = await simulateTransactionOnFork(targetContractAddress, encodedData);
  if (!isSimulationOk) {
    throw new Error("Transaction simulation failed on-chain. Aborting execution.");
  }

  // 2. Dispatch payload to Gelato Relayer instead of signing locally with a master key
  console.log("Dispatching transaction payload to secure relayer...");
  const relayerUrl = `https://api.gelato.digital/tasks/v2`;

  const response = await axios.post(relayerUrl, {
    chainId: 8453, // Base Mainnet
    target: targetContractAddress,
    data: encodedData,
    gasLimit: estimatedGasLimit.toString(),
    retries: 3
  }, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.RELAYER_API_KEY}` }
  });

  if (response.status !== 200) {
    throw new Error(`Relayer failed to queue transaction: ${response.data.message}`);
  }

  console.log(`Transaction queued successfully. Relayer Task ID: ${response.data.taskId}`);
  return response.data.taskId;
}

async function simulateTransactionOnFork(target, data) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      `https://dashboard.tenderly.co/api/v1/account/me/project/project-id/simulate`,
      {
        network_id: "8453",
        from: process.env.RELAYER_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS,
        to: target,
        input: data,
        gas: 8000000
      },
      { headers: { 'X-Access-Key': process.env.TENDERLY_API_KEY } }
    );
    return response.data.transaction.status === true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Simulation error:", error.message);
    return false;
  }
}

module.exports = { executeSecureTransaction };
```

### Flashbots & Private RPC Bundle Integration

For sensitive high-frequency transactions (e.g., arbitrage swaps and liquidation execution), frontrunning (MEV) is a major risk. An attacker can spot our transaction in the public mempool and insert their own transaction before ours (sandwiching).

#### Pros of Flashbots/Private RPC:
- **No Frontrunning:** Transactions are bypassed from the public mempool and delivered directly to validators/builders.
- **No Gas Fees on Failure:** Failed transactions are discarded by builders and do not land on-chain, saving gas.

#### Cons of Flashbots/Private RPC:
- **Execution Latency:** May take 1-2 blocks longer to execute compared to public RPCs, depending on builder inclusion rates.
- **Complexity:** Requires setting up Flashbots SDK and signing transaction bundles.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Connect via Flashbots Provider:
   ```javascript
   const { FlashbotsBundleProvider } = require("@flashbots/ethers-provider-bundle");
   const flashbotsProvider = await FlashbotsBundleProvider.create(
     provider,
     authSigner, // Reputational key (can be ephemeral)
     "https://relay.flashbots.net"
   );
   ```
2. Build, sign, and submit the bundle directly to builders:
   ```javascript
   const transactionBundle = [
     {
       transaction: signedTransaction,
       signer: wallet
     }
   ];
   const targetBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber() + 1;
   const submission = await flashbotsProvider.sendBundle(transactionBundle, targetBlock);
   ```

---

## 5. CI/CD & Deploy Policy

We enforce strict segregation between staging and production pipelines in GitHub Actions.

### Secret Management Configuration

Add these variables *only* inside **GitHub Settings → Secrets → Actions**:

*   `ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL` (or `INFURA_MAINNET_URL`) - Used only for fork testing inside CI.
*   `RENDER_API_KEY` - Used by Render deploy scripts to trigger service builds.
*   `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` - Production service identifier.
*   `RENDER_SERVICE_ID_STAGING` - Staging service identifier.
*   ❌ **SECURITY POLICY RULE:** **NEVER** add the Gnosis Safe owner keys or private keys representing actual funds to GitHub Secrets.

### Segmentation Flow

```
   [ Code Push to main ]
             │
             ▼
   ┌───────────────────┐
   │ CI Pipeline Runs  │  <-- Runs unit tests, linter, & Mainnet-Fork tests
   └───────────────────┘
             │
             ▼ (Success)
   ┌───────────────────┐
   │ Deploy to Staging │  <-- Automatic CD trigger to Render (trade-arena-staging)
   └───────────────────┘
             │
             ▼ (Manual Verification & Approval required)
   ┌───────────────────┐
   │ Deploy to Prod    │  <-- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch) with strict SRE reviewer approval
   └───────────────────┘
```

---

## 6. Testing Strategy

We follow a multi-layered testing pyramid to guarantee mainnet safety.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Simulation                 │  <-- Tenderly sandbox, live transaction Dry Runs
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│             Mainnet Fork                │  <-- Anvil/Hardhat network fork tests
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│             Integration                │  <-- Express API routes & database state tests
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                 Unit                    │  <-- Math formulas, Kelly Criterion, RSI/SMA indicators
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1.  **Unit Tests:** Verify indicator calculations (RSI, SMA, EWMA) in `public/crucible-real-trading.js` and `strategies/core/sma-crossover.js`. Run on every push.
2.  **Integration Tests:** Verify that database states, rate limiters, user log persistence, and API endpoints run correctly. Run on every push.
3.  **Mainnet-Fork Tests:** Spin up a local Fork of Base Mainnet (block pinning via Alchemy) using `scripts/fork-test.js` to test real transactions against active Uniswap/Aave liquidity. Run automatically in CI on pull requests when `ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL` is set.
4.  **Simulation & Paper-Trading:** Execute identical logic against a read-only staging node for 14 calendar days, recording virtual profits/losses, slippage, and latency reports.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Observability Plan

A real-time observability stack is vital to capture anomalies before they turn into losses.

### Target Metrics
*   **P&L tracking:** Continuous net asset value (NAV) calculations across active bots.
*   **Failed transaction rate:** Alarm triggers if more than 2 consecutive transactions revert on-chain.
*   **RPC Latency:** Real-time delay of block notifications.
*   **Wallet / Relayer Balance:** Monitored continuously. Alarm if relayer balance drops under `0.1 ETH`.
*   **Gas Spent:** Daily aggregate spending tracking to prevent runaway loop depletion.

### Observability Stack Design

```
   [ Application Logs ] ──> [ Papertrail / Datadog ] ──> Log Anomalies
            │
            ▼
   [ Prometheus Metrics ] ──> [ Grafana Dashboard ] ──> Slack & PagerDuty Alerting
```

*   **Centralized Logs:** Express logs and on-chain receipts are piped from Render directly to Papertrail or Datadog.
*   **Dashboard Visualizations:** Grafana displays live panels showing active bots, transaction queues, and network status.
*   **Alert Escalation:** Integration with PagerDuty for "Sev 1" alerts (e.g., Contract Execution Reverted, Loss Limit Exceeded).

---

## 8. Incident Response & Runbooks

In a crisis, clear instructions save money. These step-by-step procedures must be practiced before mainnet go-live.

### Runbook A: Pause All Bots ("Global Kill-Switch")
*   **Trigger Condition:** Sudden market crash, unexpected trade execution failures, API key leak, or suspicious exploit behavior.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Authenticate to the admin dashboard and click the high-visibility global Emergency Stop button.
    2.  Alternatively, call the backend directly using your terminal:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" https://trade-arena-app.onrender.com/api/admin/kill-switch
        ```
    3.  Verify in the dashboard or logs that all polling intervals (`setInterval`) and bot state arrays are set to `paused`.

### Runbook B: Emergency Fund Drain
*   **Trigger Condition:** Exploit detected on-chain, smart contract vulnerability identified, or backend server compromise.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Access the Gnosis Safe interface (`app.safe.global`) using the owner hardware wallets.
    2.  Create a transaction to transfer the entire balance of ETH and ERC-20 tokens (USDC, WETH) from the Safe Address to the pre-configured Secure Cold Wallet address.
    3.  Confirm transaction on two hardware wallets.
    4.  Verify balance reduction on the staging/production trackers to confirm the assets are safe.

### Runbook C: Respond to Exploit / Node Compromise
*   **Trigger Condition:** Unexpected external transaction signatures detected, database or UI showing unauthorized actions, or anomalous gas spikes indicating a hot-wallet leak.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Trigger Runbook A immediately (Global Kill-Switch).
    2.  Initiate Runbook B to transfer all remaining treasury funds to the secure cold wallet.
    3.  Shut down the production Render instance completely to block further server-side api requests:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY" https://api.render.com/v1/services/$RENDER_SERVICE_ID/suspend
        ```
    4.  Revoke all environment secrets and regenerate API keys (e.g., Alchemy keys, CoinGecko tokens).
    5.  Collect and archive server logs for forensic auditing.

## 9. Legal & Compliance Plan

To safely operate, the platform must navigate the regulatory landscape.

1.  **Custodial vs Non-Custodial Verification:**
    *   **Decision:** The platform must remain strictly **non-custodial**. The user's browser (Privy/MetaMask) signs transactions directly, or authorizes the backend relayer *only* for specific pre-approved trading actions. We never hold or store user private keys on the backend.
2.  **KYC/AML Requirements:**
    *   Consult legal counsel (Jordan Cruz) regarding potential requirements in different jurisdictions.
    *   Implement IP-based geo-blocking on the frontend to restrict access from restricted areas (e.g., sanctioned countries, or specific regions with strict retail derivative laws).
3.  **Auditors & Pricing:**
    *   *Recommended Auditors:* Halborn, Spearbit, or Sherlock (crowdsourced audit for cost-efficiency).
    *   *Estimated Budget:* $15,000 - $35,000.
    *   *Timeline:* 3-4 weeks.

## 10. Production Rollout & Release Gating

### Release Tagging Strategy
*   We will adopt **Semantic Versioning** (`vMajor.Minor.Patch`).
*   The first mainnet release is designated as **`v0.1.0`**.
*   All future releases require a GitHub Release Tag, auto-generating a changelog of merged PRs.

### Cutover Checklist (Go-Live Day)
1.  [ ] Verify all Phase 0 risk controls and pre-execution checks are active.
2.  [ ] Verify 14-day paper-trading run ended with zero unexpected crashes.
3.  [ ] Deploy final audited smart contracts to Base Mainnet.
4.  [ ] Initialize Gnosis Safe on Base Mainnet and fund with standard liquidity.
5.  [ ] Configure production secrets in Render (`trade-arena-app`).
6.  [ ] Trigger production build.
7.  [ ] Conduct real-money "live-smoke" transaction (swap 0.005 ETH for USDC).
8.  [ ] Test Emergency Stop (Runbook A) in production.
9.  [ ] Set live-money production bots to active under a strict 0.05 ETH per-bot limit.

## 11. Prioritized Risk Register (Top 10 Risks)

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Application Server Compromise** | Critical | Medium | Decouple signing keys from Render. Use Gnosis Safe + secure relayer. |
| **2. Flash Loan Revert Loss** | High | High | Pre-simulate every transaction via Tenderly. Halt if simulation fails. |
| **3. Sandwich Attacks (MEV)** | High | High | Use private RPC relays (like Flashbots or MEV-Share) for sensitive transactions to avoid the public mempool. |
| **4. External API Rate Limits (429)** | Medium | High | Implement local in-memory caching and graceful backoffs with jitter on API calls. |
| **5. Slippage & Frontrunning** | High | Medium | Enforce strict max-slippage caps on-chain and inside execution loops. |
| **6. Runaway Bot Loop (Gas Drain)** | High | Low | Implement daily global spending caps and gas rate limiters. |
| **7. Price Oracle Manipulation** | Critical | Low | Use multi-feed aggregator prices (Chainlink + Pyth) instead of single DEX spot prices. |
| **8. Database Lock / Race Conditions** | Medium | Medium | Migrate from single-file JSON storage (`users.json`) to SQLite/PostgreSQL. |
| **9. Regulatory Crackdown** | High | Low | Explicit Non-Custodial design + Terms of Service + strict Geo-blocking. |
| **10. Third-Party Smart Contract Hack** | Critical | Low | Limit exposure per protocol. Diversify liquidity across Uniswap, Sushi, and Curve. |

## 13. Backups & Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan

To prevent data loss and ensure rapid service restoration in the event of hardware or host provider failures:
1. **DB Backups Schedule:** For SQLite or PostgreSQL databases on Render/AWS, configure automated nightly snapshots retained for 30 calendar days.
2. **Backup Integrity Verification:** Run weekly automated restore simulation scripts in the staging pipeline to verify backup viability.
3. **Secrets Rotation Policy:** Force rotate all system API keys and secrets every 90 days, or immediately following any team credential change.
