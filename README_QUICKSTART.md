## 20-Minute Deep Dive

### Master Switch Features
```
MASTER ✗ OFF  →  All bots disabled globally
                  Useful when you want to pause everything
                  Saves keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Space

MASTER ✓ ON   →  All bots enabled
                  Each bot respects its own AUTO setting
                  Syncs with emergency stop button
```

### Real-Time Balance Updates
The balance in the header (`$10,000.00`) updates **every 1 second**:

```
🟢 Green   (+5%+)    → Strong gain
🔵 Cyan    (+1 to +5%)  → Small gain
🟡 Gold    (-1 to +1%)  → Neutral
🟠 Amber   (-5 to -1%)  → Small loss
🔴 Red     (-5%-)   → Large loss
```

Open positions show as `(live)`:
```
Before:  +$0.00 today
Active:  +$50.25 today (live)  ← unrealised gains
Closed:  +$150.50 today        ← realised gains
```

### Quant Report (After 10+ Trades)
Auto-opens after 10 closed trades:

- **Win Rate**: % profitable
- **Profit Factor**: Wins / Losses ratio
- **Max Drawdown**: Biggest dip
- **Equity Curve**: Account balance over time
- **Baselines**: Beat random/momentum to prove edge

### Learning Model (After 5 Trades)
Watch agent weights evolve in **SELF-LEARNING MODEL** panel:

```
Example after 20 trades:
🔥 Momentum:  1.23  (↑ rising - doing well)
🌀 Volatility: 0.82 (↓ falling - struggling)
🏛️ Politician: 1.0  (— stable)
📊 Sentiment:  1.15 (↑ rising)
🛡️ Risk:      0.95 (↓ slight drop)
```

Weights auto-adjust based on accuracy.
