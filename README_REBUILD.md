## 📋 How to Use

### Login
Choose one of three options:
1. **Google Sign-In** - Requires Google Client ID setup
2. **MetaMask Wallet** - Connects to your Web3 wallet
3. **Demo Mode** - No setup needed, instant entry (recommended for testing)

### Control All Bots at Once
Click the **MASTER** toggle in the top-right to turn all bots on/off together. This affects:
- All bot AUTO buttons
- All timers and pending spins
- Respects the 3-trade cooldown system

### Monitor Real-Time Changes
Watch the **Balance** in the header update every second as positions open and close. The color changes dynamically to show your P&L status.

### View Detailed Analytics

- **Agent Audit** - Monitor individual agent performance
- **Circuit Breakers** - Set gas limits, drawdown stops, and risk controls

## 🎯 Bot Mechanics

### Spinning
1. Set your bet amount ($1–$100)
2. Click **SPIN** to run the 5-agent ensemble
3. Agents vote: LONG, SHORT, or HOLD
4. If consensus threshold met, position opens
5. Position auto-closes after strategy hold-time (5–30 min)

### Auto Mode
1. Click **AUTO** to enable continuous spinning
2. Bots spin every 2–4 seconds when enabled
3. Master switch controls all bots globally
4. Use **STOP** button to disable a single bot

### Cooldown System
- **3 consecutive losses** → 15-min cooldown (choppy market)
- **3 more losses after resume** → 60-min cooldown
- **Another streak** → 24-hr manual reset required
- Hold to override early (3-second hold)

---

## 🧬 Self-Learning Model

### How It Works
- **Every 5 closed trades**: Agent weights update based on accuracy
- **Every 20 trades**: Consensus threshold auto-adjusts based on win rate
- **Every 10 trades**: Automatic audit checks individual agent performance
- State persists in browser storage; no setup required

### Agent Performance
Watch the weight cards in the **SELF-LEARNING MODEL** panel:
- 🔥 **Momentum** - Trades directional moves
- 🌀 **Volatility** - Classifies market regime
- 🏛️ **Politician** - Congressional insider filings signal
- 📊 **Sentiment** - Crowd momentum
- 🛡️ **Risk** - Vetoes dangerous trades

Higher weight = agent voting with more confidence.

### Agent Audit
Agents go "on notice" if win rate drops below threshold:
- **On Notice**: Weight capped, improvement plan injected into prompt
- **Suspended** (after full probation): Vote nearly muted
- **Reinstated**: Partial weight restoration on recovery

## 🔬 Quant Report (Stats)

### Statistical Ladder
- Shows progress to significance milestones (20, 50, 100, 200, 300 trades)
- Confidence grows as sample size increases

### Core Metrics
- **Win Rate** - % of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor** - Gross wins / gross losses
- **Expectancy** - Average P&L per trade
- **Max Drawdown** - Worst peak-to-trough loss

### Baselines
Compares Claude AI strategy against shadow strategies:
- 🎲 **Random** - Coin flip direction
- 📈 **Always Long** - Buy and hold
- 🌊 **Momentum** - 15min price move direction

Beat the momentum baseline = real skill, not just luck.

### Equity Curve
Visual line chart of account balance over time. Green line = profitable, red = losing streak.

## ⚙️ Circuit Breakers

### Gas Hard Ceiling
- Default: 50 gwei
- Bots pause when live gas exceeds this
- Drag the slider to test different gas scenarios

### Daily Drawdown Kill
- Default: -10% of starting balance
- All bots stop if daily loss exceeds this threshold
- Prevents catastrophic blowups

### Aggression Level (1–10)
- 1 = Ultra cautious (fewest trades)
- 10 = Full degen (maximum trades)
- Affects how agents rate entry opportunities

### Consensus Threshold (1–4 agents)
- Minimum agents that must agree to open a trade
- Auto-adapts every 20 trades based on win rate
- 2 = moderate (default), 3 = cautious, 4 = unanimous

---

## 🔴 Emergency Stop

Click **🔴 EMERGENCY STOP ALL BOTS** to:
- Disable all bots instantly
- Clear auto-timers
- Freeze trading (master switch turns red)
- Click **🟢 RESET — RESUME TRADING** to re-enable

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Master Switch Not Working
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try clicking a bot's AUTO button manually first

### Balance Not Updating
- Wait 1–2 seconds for next update cycle
- Check that `ghBalance` element exists in HTML
- Refresh page if stuck

### Bots Not Spinning
- Check if global emergency stop (🔴) is active
- Verify gas ceiling not exceeded
- Check daily drawdown hasn't triggered
- Try clicking SPIN manually first

### No Claude AI Responses
- API key not set (uses rule-based fallback)
- API circuit breaker active (60s cooldown after 3 failures)
- Check browser console for `401` or network errors
- Provide API key in the setup note on login screen
