## The 3 Bugs

### Bug #1: Negative Balance ❌ → FIXED ✅
**What was happening**: Trades could open even if you didn't have enough money
```
Balance: $2.00
Bet: $5.00
Result: Balance goes to -$3.00 ❌ BROKEN
```
**What now happens**: Trades are rejected with clear error
```
Balance: $2.00
Bet: $5.00
Result: "❌ Insufficient balance ($2.00 < $5.00)" ✅ FIXED
```

### Bug #2: Costs Too High ❌ → FIXED ✅
**What was happening**: Costs could be so high that winning was impossible
```
Bet: $1.00
Gas: $0.50
Slippage: $0.40
Spread: $0.30
Total Cost: $1.20 ❌ COSTS > BET!
Result: Even if price goes up 10%, you still lose money
```
**What now happens**: Costs are capped at 50% of bet
```
Bet: $1.00
Maximum Cost: $0.50 (50% of bet) ✅ FIXED
Result: 50% remains for actual profit/loss
```

---

### Bug #3: Trades Keep Going When Broke ❌ → FIXED ✅
**What was happening**: System would keep trying to trade even with $0 balance
```
Balance: $0.05
Crucible Test: 50 trades
Result: Keeps spinning, creates errors ❌ BROKEN
```
**What now happens**: Trades automatically stop when low on balance
```
Balance: $0.05
Minimum to trade: $0.10
Result: "🚫 Insufficient balance to trade" ✅ STOPS GRACEFULLY
```

## Technical Details

### Code Change #1: Cost Capping (Line 958-960)

const totalCost = Math.min(totalRaw, bet * 0.5) * multiplier;
```

### Code Change #2: Trade Opening Validation (Line 991-1005)
```javascript
// Check if sufficient balance exists before opening trade
if(balance < bet) {
  // Show error and reject trade
  return null;
}
```

### Code Change #3: Spin Function Guard (Line 1838-1842)
```javascript
// Prevent spinning if balance is insufficient for minimum bet
if(balance < 0.10) {
  // Stop and show message
  return;
}
```
