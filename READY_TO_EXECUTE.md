## 📊 THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE

### Old P&L Calculation
```javascript
trade.pnl = Math.random() < winRate ? +30 : -10
```
- 🎲 Coin flip
- 🎲 Fixed amount
- 🎲 Not connected to prices
- 🎲 Impossible results

### New P&L Calculation
```javascript
trade.pnlAUD = (position * priceMove%) - fees
```
- 📊 Real market data
- 📊 Based on price movement
- 📊 Realistic fee structure
- 📊 Reproducible results

## ✨ WHAT'S INSIDE THE ENGINE

### 1. Real Data Pipeline
```
CoinGecko API
    ↓
OHLCV Data (BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, XRP)
    ↓
180 candles × 5 assets = 900 real data points
```

### 2. Technical Analysis
```
Close Prices
    ↓
RSI (Relative Strength Index)
SMA5 & SMA10 (Moving Averages)
Volatility (Std Dev)
Momentum (Rate of Change)
    ↓
Signal Confidence (0-100%)
```

### 3. Adaptive Strategies
```
MOMENTUM_LONG:        Positive momentum + RSI > 45
MOMENTUM_SHORT:       Negative momentum + RSI < 55
MEAN_REVERSION:       Overbought/oversold reversals
VOLATILITY_BREAKOUT:  High vol + directional move
```

### 4. Real Execution
```
Entry: Real CoinGecko price
Exit: Technical target (2.5% TP or 1% SL)
Fees: 0.25% round-trip
Position Size: 2% of equity
```

### 5. AI Learning
```
Track each strategy's performance
Measure: Win rate, profit factor
Adapt: Entry thresholds, confidence scaling
Optimize: Volatility-aware position sizing
```
