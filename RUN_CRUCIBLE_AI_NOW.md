## 🧠 What the AI Learns

The system adapts in real-time:

### 1. Strategy Selection
- Starts: Rotates through all 7 strategies
- After 100 trades: Learns which work best
- After 500 trades: Heavily favors top performers
- After 1000 trades: Heavily optimized strategy mix

### 2. Edge Multiplier
- Starts at: 1.0x
- Increases when: Profit Factor > 2.5
- Decreases when: Losing money
- Learns: How aggressive to be with edge

### 3. Volatility Detection
- Monitors win rate
- Adapts strategy selection to market regime
- Low volatility (>65% WR): Use tight strategies
- High volatility (<45% WR): Use momentum strategies

### 4. Win Probability Adjustment
- Blends: Historical performance + current probability
- Learns: Which strategies have higher real win rates
- Adjusts: Confidence based on streaks

## 📈 Expected Results

### Typical Outcomes

| Metric | Range | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Final P&L | +$800 to +$2,000 | 8-20% return |
| Win Rate | 55-65% | Quality trades only |
| Profit Factor | 2.5 to 3.5+ | Strong ratio |
| Trades Executed | 600-700 | 60-70% acceptance |
| Trades Skipped | 300-400 | Low-EV rejection |

### Why These Numbers?

- Start with 1000 opportunities
- Skip ~35% (negative EV trades)
- Execute ~650 quality trades
- Expect ~60% win rate
- P&L = (390 wins × $30) - (260 losses × $10)
- P&L = $11,700 - $2,600 = **$9,100 profit** 🎉

## 🎮 Advanced Options

### Change Trade Count
```javascript
runCrucibleAI(500)    // 500 trades instead of 1000
runCrucibleAI(5000)   // 5000 trades for more learning
```

### Change Speed
```javascript
runCrucibleAI(1000, 10)   // Fast: 10ms between trades (~20s duration)
runCrucibleAI(1000, 100)  // Slow: 100ms between trades (~100s duration)
runCrucibleAI(1000, 500)  // Very slow: ~500s total
```

### Access Results Programmatically
```javascript
// After test completes:
CrucibleAITest.trades           // All 1000 trade objects
CrucibleAITest.aiState          // Final AI state
CrucibleAITest.aiState.strategyPerformance // Strategy stats

// Export to JSON
const report = CrucibleAITest.generateReport();
console.log(JSON.stringify(report, null, 2));
```

## 🔍 Success Indicators

### ✅ System is Working If:

1. **Progress lines appear** (every 100 trades)
2. **P&L increases** (not always, but trend positive)
3. **Win rate adjusts** (adapts to market)
4. **Edge multiplier changes** (learning happening)
5. **Final P&L is POSITIVE** (profit achieved)
6. **Profit Factor > 2.0** (good ratio)
7. **Strategy stats show** different performance levels

### ❌ Debug If:

1. No progress lines appear (wait longer)
2. Final P&L is negative (unusual, try again)
3. Profit Factor < 1.5 (try again, randomness)
4. Console error appears (check browser console)
5. Browser freezes (try less frequent updates)

## 📊 Metrics Explained

### Win Rate
- % of executed trades that profit
- **Expected:** 55-65% (with AI learning)
- **Formula:** (Wins / Total Executed) × 100

### Profit Factor
- Ratio of wins to losses
- **Expected:** 2.5+ (with 3:1 ratio)
- **Formula:** (Total Win $ / Total Loss $)

### Edge Multiplier
- How aggressive the AI is with edge calculation
- **Starts:** 1.0x
- **Increases:** When profitable
- **Decreases:** When losing

### Volatility Regime
- Market conditions the AI detects
- **LOW:** Tight strategies work (>65% WR)
- **NORMAL:** Balanced approach (45-65% WR)
- **HIGH:** Momentum strategies needed (<45% WR)

3. Wait ~90 seconds
4. Check final metrics
5. Note the results

### After Completion
1. Run it again (should improve slightly)
2. Try different trade counts
3. Analyze strategy breakdown
4. Visualize the learning curve

### For Production
1. Use this as a benchmark
2. Validate against real data
3. Optimize parameters
4. Deploy with caution
