ethereumExists: false
```

---

## The Solution (Simple Too!)

Pick ONE of these based on your situation:

---

## ✅ Option A: Install MetaMask (Most Likely)

### If you DON'T have MetaMask installed:

1. **Go to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)**
2. **Click "Download"**
3. **Select your browser** (Chrome shown in your case)
4. **Click "Add Extension"**
5. **Click "Add" in the popup**
6. **Wait for installation to complete**
7. **MetaMask fox icon** 🦊 **will appear in top-right**
8. **Complete wallet setup**:
   - Create new wallet, OR
   - Import with seed phrase
9. **Return to this page**
10. **Click "METAMASK / WALLET"**
11. **Approve in MetaMask popup**
12. **Done!** 🎉

---

## ✅ Option B: Exit Private Mode (Very Likely)

### If you're in Private/Incognito Mode:

1. **Look at your browser window**
2. **Do you see "Private" or "InPrivate" or "Incognito" text?**

**If YES**:
1. **Close this tab**
2. **Open a NEW NORMAL window** (not private)
3. **Go to this page again**
4. **Click "METAMASK / WALLET"**
5. **Done!** 🎉

---

## ✅ Option C: Enable MetaMask (If Already Installed)

### If MetaMask is installed but not showing:

1. **Click the puzzle piece 🧩 icon** (top-right)
2. **Find MetaMask** in the list
3. **Click the **PIN icon** to enable it**
4. **Fox icon 🦊 should now appear**
5. **Click fox icon**
6. **Unlock wallet** (enter password if needed)
7. **Return to this page**
8. **Click "METAMASK / WALLET"**
9. **Done!** 🎉

---

## 🔄 After Installing/Enabling

### Verify It's Working:

1. **Refresh page**: F5 or Ctrl+R
2. **Open console**: F12
3. **Run this**: `diagnoseMetaMask()`
4. **Look for**:
   ```
   ethereumExists: true  ✅ (was false)
   isMetaMask: true      ✅ (was undefined)
   ```

If you see these as `true`, MetaMask is working!

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

Once MetaMask is installed/enabled:

1. **Click "METAMASK / WALLET"** button
2. **Does MetaMask popup appear?**
   - **YES** → Click "Connect" → Done! 🎉
   - **NO** → MetaMask still not detected, try refreshing

---

## 📊 Why It Wasn't Working

Your diagnostic showed:
```
Browser: Chrome 145 ✅ (correct)
window.ethereum: undefined ❌ (MetaMask not injected)
isMetaMask: undefined ❌ (MetaMask not detected)
```

**Root cause**: MetaMask extension not installed or not enabled

---

## ⏱️ Time Required

- **Install MetaMask**: 2-3 minutes
- **Create wallet**: 5 minutes (one-time)
- **Set up page**: 1 minute
- **Total**: 8-10 minutes

---

- [ ] NOT in private/incognito mode
- [ ] Fox icon 🦊 visible in toolbar
- [ ] Wallet created and unlocked

## 🎯 DO THIS NOW

**Pick your situation**:

1. **"I don't have MetaMask"**
   → Go to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io) and install

2. **"I'm in private/incognito mode"**
   → Open a normal window instead

3. **"I have MetaMask but icon doesn't show"**
   → Click puzzle piece, find MetaMask, click pin

4. **"Still not working"**
   → Refresh page (F5) and try again

---

## 💡 Why MetaMask Injection Failed

When a webpage loads, MetaMask:
1. Detects it's a browser
2. Injects `window.ethereum` object
3. This object allows the app to connect

**Your app is ready!** It just needs MetaMask to inject the object.

Once MetaMask is installed and enabled, the injection happens automatically.

---

**Install MetaMask and try again - it will work!** 💪
