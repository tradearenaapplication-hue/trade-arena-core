## 💡 WHAT IS AI ARENA?

**Simple Version:**
3 AI models compete → Best one wins → Execute trade

**Models:**
- 🔬 ANALYST: Conservative, good in choppy markets
- ⚡ TRADER: Aggressive, good in bullish markets
- 🎯 STRATEGIST: Balanced, good everywhere

**How It Works:**
1. Market data arrives
2. All 3 models analyze (in parallel)
3. Each votes on best trade
4. Highest vote score wins
5. Execute & track result

---

## 🔍 CONSOLE COMMANDS

### See Last Tournament:
```javascript
console.log(arenaState.lastTournament);
```
Shows all proposals, votes, winner, execution result

### See Model Performance:
```javascript
console.log(arenaState.modelPerformance);
// { ANALYST: { wins: X, losses: Y, accuracy: Z% },
//   TRADER: { ... },
//   STRATEGIST: { ... } }
```

### Get Insights:
```javascript
console.log(getArenaInsights());
// Shows: Best model, accuracies, total tournaments

}
```

### Adjust Voting Weights:
```javascript
voting: {
  confidence_weight: 0.5,    // Emphasize confidence
  edge_weight: 0.2,          // De-emphasize edge
}
```
