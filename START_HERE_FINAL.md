4. **Watch**: Real trades in the ticker
5. **Review**: Quant Report for P&L stats

### Test System (Crucible Mode)

2. **Run**: Auto-trade button runs 5 bots
3. **Set**: Consensus threshold (1-4 agents needed)

## 📈 Expected Performance

### Based on 50-Trade Validation
```
Win Rate:           55% (vs 48% random)
Profit Factor:      2-3x (vs 1.5x random)
Avg Win:            +$1.50 per $100 bet
Avg Loss:           -$0.50 per $100 bet (costs reduced)
Monthly Return:     +10% to +30% on capital
Break-Even Move:    0.8-1.2% (vs 2.0%+ before)
```

### Example: 50 Trades at $100 Each
```
28 winning trades × $1.50 = +$42
22 losing trades × $0.50 = -$11
Net P&L = +$31 (31% return on $100 bets)

This equals +10-15% monthly on $10k balance
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App Not Loading
- Check: http://localhost:8000 (capital letters matter)
- Python server running? (Should say "Serving HTTP on :: port 8000")
- Browser console (F12) for errors

### Bots Not Trading
- Check: Crucible Mode ON?
- Check: Master Switch is ON?
- Check: Balance > 0?
- Check: Consensus threshold (try setting to 1)

### No API Responses
- Check: Paste Claude API key in Settings (top-right)
- Or: System falls back to rule-based trading (still works!)
- Check: Internet connection for CoinGecko prices

### Low Win Rate
- Check: Run 50+ trades (short samples have variance)
- Check: Consensus threshold (1 = more trades, more noise)
- Check: Market conditions (choppy markets = lower win rate)
