## How Auto Mode Adapts

### Edge Adjustment
```
Base Edge (from Claude AI)
  ↓
+ Win Probability adjustment
+ Volatility adjustment (based on profile)
+ Consecutive wins/loss adjustment
= Final Adaptive Edge
```

### Bet Sizing
```
Base Bet (your selection)
  ↓
× Profile multiplier (0.5-1.5x)
× Volatility multiplier (0.5-1.3x)
× Loss streak reduction (0.7-0.5x)
× Win streak increase (1.0-1.1x)
= Final Adaptive Bet
```

### Risk Management
```
Each bot stops trading if:
✓ 5+ consecutive losses
✓ Session loss > max drawdown
✓ Market crash (conservative profiles)
✓ Insufficient balance
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Edge changing a lot"
- **Normal**: System adapts to win rate
- **Check**: Win rate too variable?
- **Fix**: Use CONSERVATIVE profile for stability

### "Bet size shrinking"
- **Normal**: System protecting capital after losses
- **Check**: Losing streak happening?
- **Fix**: Let bot pause automatically or reset

### "Same method every trade"
- **Normal**: Market condition hasn't changed
- **Check**: Try different volatility profiles
- **Fix**: Run multiple bots with different profiles

### "Win rate below 50%"
- **Normal**: AI not always accurate
- **Check**: Strategy profile matched to market?
- **Fix**: Try different profile for current market

## Data Export (Console)

### Get everything for one bot:
```javascript
const bot = botStrategies[1];
console.table({
  Profile: bot.profile,
  Trades: bot.tradesCount,
  Session P&L: '$' + bot.sessionPnL.toFixed(2),
  Win Rate: (bot.recentPnL.filter(p=>p>0).length / bot.recentPnL.length * 100).toFixed(1) + '%',
  Best Method: Object.keys(bot.methodBias).sort((a,b) =>
    (bot.methodBias[b].avgPnL || 0) - (bot.methodBias[a].avgPnL || 0))[0]
});
```

### Get all bots summary:
```javascript
Object.values(botStrategies).forEach(b => {
  console.log(`Bot #${b.botId} (${b.profile}): ${b.tradesCount} trades, $${b.sessionPnL.toFixed(2)} P&L`);
});
```
