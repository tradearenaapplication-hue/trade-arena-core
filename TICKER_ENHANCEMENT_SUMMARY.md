### Action Logging Flow

2. P&L calculated
3. recordTradeInTicker(botId, pnl) called
4. tickerGraph.recordTrade() executes
5. Color determined (green/red based on P&L)
6. Action created: "✅ +$150" or "❌ -$50"
7. logAction() stores in botActionLogs array
8. Old actions removed if >8
9. updateLegend() refreshes display
10. User sees action immediately
```

### Master Auto Control Flow

```
1. User clicks 🤖 AUTO OFF button
2. toggleMasterAuto() function called
3. masterAutoEnabled flag toggled
4. Loop through all bots
5. Set bot.auto = true/false for each
6. Update individual AUTO buttons
7. Update card styling
8. Start/stop scheduleAutoSpin
9. Update master button appearance
10. Log to actionLogger
11. User sees all bots start/stop auto
```
