  hasCanvas: tickerGraph?.canvas !== null,
  hasBots: bots?.length || 0,
  trades: Object.keys(tickerGraph?.botHistory || {}).length
});

// View all bot data
Object.entries(tickerGraph.botHistory).forEach(([id, trades]) => {
  console.log(`Bot ${id}: ${trades.length} trades, P&L: $${trades[trades.length-1]?.cumulative.toFixed(2) || 0}`);
});

// Force redraw
tickerGraph.draw();

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Chart shows nothing
1. Did you trade yet? (Click SPIN button)
2. Check console: `Object.keys(tickerGraph.botHistory)`
3. Should show bot IDs like: `["1", "2", "3"]`

### Legend doesn't show bots
1. Check: `bots.length` (should be > 0)
2. Check: `tickerGraph.botHistory` (should have data)
3. Try: Refresh page and login again

### Colored lines don't show
1. Check: `tickerGraph.canvas.width` (should not be 0)
2. Try: Resize browser window
3. Check console for errors (F12)

### Console shows errors
1. Check: Is [Ticker] before the error?
2. If yes, that's expected - we log and recover
3. App should still work normally
4. Report only RED errors without [Ticker]
