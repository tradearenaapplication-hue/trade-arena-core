## 🔬 Test Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Smoke Test (5 trades)
```javascript
runCrucibleTest(5, 2000)
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All 5 trades complete
- [ ] No console errors (only expected CORS debug)

- [ ] P&L calculations visible
- [ ] Balance updates sequentially

**Expected Results:**
- Duration: ~12-15 seconds
- Win Rate: 40-60% (natural randomness)
- Total P&L: +/- $200-$300

---

### Step 2: Medium Test (20 trades)

- [ ] Balance never goes negative
- [ ] Export functions work

**Expected Results:**
- Duration: ~35-45 seconds
- Win Rate: 45-65%
- Total P&L: +$0 to +$2000

---

### Step 3: Extended Test (50 trades)
```javascript
runCrucibleTest(50, 1000)
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] System stability over 50 trades
- [ ] No memory leaks or slowdowns

## 🔍 Detailed Validation

### Trade Entry/Exit Logic
```
VERIFY EACH TRADE:
├─ Entry price: 1000 < price < 100000 ✓
├─ Exit price: price ≠ entry (realistic change) ✓
├─ Price diff: < 10% of entry (realistic) ✓
├─ P&L sign: matches win/loss determination ✓
└─ Balance: updates = previous + P&L ✓
```

### Win/Loss Determination
```
VERIFY PROBABILITY:
├─ Win probability in range [45%, 80%] ✓
├─ Loss probability = 100% - win prob ✓
├─ Actual wins ≈ Expected (bell curve) ✓
└─ No bias toward wins or losses ✓
```

### P&L Calculation
```
VERIFY MATH:
├─ Win: (entry × (1 + edge%)) - entry = P&L ✓
├─ Loss: -(randomLoss) = P&L ✓
├─ Sign correct: positive for wins ✓
├─ Magnitude reasonable: $10-$400 ✓
└─ Cumulative accurate: no rounding errors ✓
```

### Balance Tracking
```
VERIFY UPDATES:
├─ Initial balance: $10,000 ✓
├─ After trade 1: $10,000 + pnl_1 ✓
├─ After trade 2: $10,000 + pnl_1 + pnl_2 ✓
├─ Final balance: sum of all P&L ✓
└─ Never negative (with typical results) ✓
```

## 📈 Next Steps After Passing

1. **Run 3 validation tests:**
   ```javascript
   runCrucibleTest(30, 1500)  // Test 1
   // Wait for completion
   runCrucibleTest(30, 1500)  // Test 2
   // Wait for completion
   runCrucibleTest(30, 1500)  // Test 3
   ```

2. **Compare results:**
   - Win rates should be similar (±5%)
   - P&L ranges should overlap
   - Consistency confirms logic robustness

3. **Export all results:**
   ```javascript
   exportCrucibleJSON()
   exportCrucibleCSV()
   ```

4. **Document findings:**
   - Save test results
   - Note any anomalies
   - Create deployment report

5. **Deploy to live trading:**
   - Apply same logic to real trades
   - Monitor vs. test predictions
   - Scale position size gradually

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Test fails to complete
**Action:** Check console for errors, run `stopCrucibleTest()`, then retry

### Win rate suspiciously high (>80%)
**Check:** Win probability calculation, verify randomness, check edge logic

### Win rate suspiciously low (<40%)
**Check:** Loss amount calculation, verify exit price logic, review edge logic

### Balance doesn't match expected
**Verify:** Each trade's P&L, accumulated sum, no missed trades

### Exports don't work
**Try:**
1. Check browser console
2. Try different format (JSON vs CSV)
3. Check file download permissions
